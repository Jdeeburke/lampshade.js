# Lampshade.js

Lampshade is a tool for simplifying some everyday tasks associated with development on a LAMP stack.

This is brand spanking new and currently only works for Debian/Ubuntu-based systems running Apache2.

The only functionality in place so far is for managing Apache virtualhosts.

## Installation
`npm install -g lampshade`

## Usage
`lampshade vhosts list`

`lampshade vhosts create`

`lampshade vhosts enable`

`lampshade vhosts disable`
